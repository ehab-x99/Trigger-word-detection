# Trigger Word Detection
Trigger word detection is a technique used to identify a specific word or phrase within an audio stream. This can be useful in a variety of applications, such as voice assistants, where the trigger word is used to activate the system.

This project is an implementation of a trigger word detection system using deep learning techniques. The system is trained on an audio dataset and is able to detect the trigger word within a stream of real-time audio.

# Customizing the Trigger Word
To change the trigger word, you can edit the TRIGGER_WORD constant in the detection.py script. The trigger word should be a single word or short phrase that is easy to pronounce and not commonly used in conversation.

# Limitations
The trigger word detection system is sensitive to noise and may sometimes trigger falsely or fail to trigger when the trigger word is spoken. It is also limited to detecting a single trigger word and is not able to detect multiple trigger words or trigger words
